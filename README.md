# Diffusion-aware Censored Gaussian Processes

Diffusion-aware Censored Demand Models combine a Tobit likelihood with a graph diffusion process in order to model the latent process of transfer of unsatisfied demand between similar products or services. 

Please refer to the original paper for details: **Diffusion-aware Censored Gaussian Processes for Demand Modelling.  Rodrigues, F., ArXiv., 2025**.

See the "demo_*" Jupyter notebooks for the code for the experiments provided in the paper and examples of how to use the Diffusion-aware Censored GP.
